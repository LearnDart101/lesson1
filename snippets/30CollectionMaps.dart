    Collection Maps

    NB: Dart doesn't support array, dart:core library support Collection which support structure like array

    The Map object is a simple key/value pair, more like associative array.

    Maps can grow and shrink at runtime.

  var details = new Map(); 
  details['Usrname']='admin'; 
  details['Password']='admin@123';
