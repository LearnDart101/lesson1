    Dart Constructors
    Responsible for initializing the variables of the class

    Dart defines a constructor with the same name as that of the class. A constructor is a function and hence can be parameterized. However, unlike a function, constructors cannot have a return type. If you donâ€™t declare a constructor, a default no-argument constructor is provided for you.
